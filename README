CGI::Application::Framework (CAF), a fully-featured web application
development platform built on CGI::Application.

The INSTALL.txt document tells you how to install the CAF.

CGI::Application::Framework was originally developed by Richard Dice under the 
name CGI::Application::MVCFramework and under the generous auspices of LPI, the
Linux Professional Institute (http://www.lpi.org/).  Many thanks to G. Matthew Rice
and Rick Delaney at LPI for their support and encouragement througout the whole
project, technical and otherwise.

Since then, the package has been massively reworked by Michael Graham, and renamed
to CGI::Application::Framework.

After several months of post-YAPC::NA 2005 burn-out (Richard and Michael were/are
two of the key organizers of the Toronto.pm conference production team) we finally
got our collective butts in gear and got the package finally ready for
"alpha quality general release" to CPAN.  Share - and enjoy!
