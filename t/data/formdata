As he landed his crew with care; 
Supporting each man on the top of the tide 
By a finger entwined in his hair.

  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  And the mome raths outgrabe.

Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright--
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
